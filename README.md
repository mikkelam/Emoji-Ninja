## Downloads
Pre-built application bundles can be downloaded from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/mikkelam/emoji-ninja/releases/).

Note that the app bundles are not signed and notarised (as I'm currently not paying Apple for the privilege), so you'll need to [disable Gatekeeper](https://disable-gatekeeper.github.io) for Emoji Ninja. I apologize for this inconvenience.
