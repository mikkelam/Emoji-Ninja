## Downloads
Pre-built application bundles can be downloaded from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/mikkelam/emoji-ninja/releases/).

**Installation:** Since the app is unsigned (keeping it free!), macOS will show a security warning on first launch.

**To install:**
1. Download and extract the app to Applications
2. **Right-click** the app and select **"Open"**
3. Click **"Open"** in the security dialog
4. The app will now launch normally in the future

This is the standard process for many free Mac apps and only needs to be done once.

**Troubleshooting:** If you get a "damaged and can't be opened" error instead, try either:

**Option 1 - System Settings:**
Go to System Settings → Privacy & Security → scroll down to find "Emoji Ninja" and click "Open Anyway"

**Option 2 - Terminal command:**
```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Emoji Ninja.app"
```

Both methods remove the quarantine flag that triggers the stronger security block. The app isn't actually damaged - this is just macOS being extra cautious with unsigned apps. This is needed because I don't pay the Apple developer tax.
